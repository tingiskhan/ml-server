# Serving machine learning models

This library provides some basic functionality for serving machine  
learning models from a flask server via an API. It serves more as a
tutorial of how to rather than production grade server, and is as such  
more of a complement to the lightweight/specific services often found in  
blogs. It has been developed with cloud architecture in mind, but works
well in other situations as well.

## Install
While you could install the library, the installation is more aimed at  
providing a simple way of deploying using Docker.
